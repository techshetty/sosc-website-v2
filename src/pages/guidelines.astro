        <p>
          Welcome to Sahyadri Open-Source Community. We are a community of tech
          enthusiasts working hard to spread knowledge and strengthen the
          collaborative culture among young minds. SOSC was born through the
          convergence of Technical clubs at Sahyadri — Mozilla Campus Club,
          Developer Students Club, and some aspiring individuals who are keen to
          share knowledge for the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOSC is a community. When you talk, post, or reply, there are people
          reading what you say. These people have dreams, perspectives,
          feelings, and experiences just like you. You might meet many through
          events like Hackathons or conferences. Treat everyone like a potential
          friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document makes SOSC a welcoming place. The rules apply to all
          core members, volunteers, and participants. This isn't an exhaustive
          list but a spirit — a guide to be excellent to each other.

        <p>
          Disagreements happen, but poor behavior isn't allowed. A productive
          community is a safe one. Respect fellow members and outsiders alike.

      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Be Nice and Do Not Harass Others</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone should feel welcome. Any harassment will result in removal.
          Harassment includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Offensive comments about identity, appearance, or beliefs</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention or contact</li>
          <li>Threats, intimidation, or stalking</li>
          <li>Deliberate disruption or targeted harassment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If harassment occurs, comply when asked to stop. Report incidents to
          organizers. They may involve security or take other actions to protect
          members.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Communicate Effectively</h2>
        <p>
          We all communicate differently. Clear, respectful communication avoids
          misunderstandings. Ask for clarification when needed. Avoid trolling,
          flame wars, or personal attacks.
        </p>

      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Unaffiliated Promotions</h2>
        <p>
          Don't promote unrelated content without permission. Persistent
          promotion may result in removal. Contact the listed organizers for
          approval before promoting anything.
        </p>

      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Violating the Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          Violations may lead to a 6-month suspension or permanent removal,
          based on severity, as decided by the community leads.
