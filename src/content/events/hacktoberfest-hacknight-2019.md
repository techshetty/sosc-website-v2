### Prerequisites

Nothing really, atleast one laptop per team. First year engineering participants don't need to know coding since they can use any techstack of their choice including MIT App Inventor, Thunkable, Scratch etc... (the mentor will be guiding them regarding the same)

### Problem Statements

#### 1. Application to add details of participation in events with certificate(s), where certificate has to be verified by In-Charge.

#### 2. Departmental Application (Website/Application for a department(s) in college to handle details)

#### 3. Job Portal

    Students can add interview questions, videos etc..., company heads can check which students are interested.

#### Aptra Problem Statement

1. Optical character recognition (OCR) (handwritten Kannada) images to text or pdf
   format. <br />
   Optical character recognition (OCR) software is capable of turning images (handwritten
   Kannada) into text or pdf, but it is not perfect. There are sources of errors that occur because of
   the nature of the image itself (rotation, sizing, etc.) that should be handled, but there are other
   sources of errors that need to be handled, after the image is converted to text. Among the more
   common types of errors are segmentation errors (`too m uc h wh itespac e` or `toolittle
whitespace`), `character rnisrecognitioii`, smudges that could cause misrecognition of
   `pun,ctuation`.
   Your challenge is to train a model to find and correct the types of common issues described
   above to more than 85% accuracy.

2. Chatbot for retrieving data from database <br />
   Develop the Chatbot to fetch the data from database as per users input. Consider the student
   table from which chat bot have to fetch the required data such as number of students or marks or
   topper list or section list or phone number of particular student and so on.
