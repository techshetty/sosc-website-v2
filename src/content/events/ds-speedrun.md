## DS Speedrun

Data Structure is an important concept in Computer Science. We use different datastructures throughout our engineering career and it is an important aspect of technical interviews/rounds. We'll be covering the basics of Data Structures and solve interesting problems.

- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists(SSL/DLL)
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hashmaps

### Time: 01.00 PM IST

## Topics Covered

- What is Data Structure
- Types of Data Structures
- Abstract Data Type(Structures)
- Stacks and Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graph Traversal
- Hashmaps

## Prerequisites

- Basics of C Programming
- Laptop (optional)
- C Compiler (optional)

## This is a BYOC event

We'll be giving you hands-on experience on Data Structures. So the event is Bring Your Own Computer workshop, your Laptops will be of great help here. If you don't have a laptop, we'll provide you with lab computers.

## Absolutely Free!

Since this is a community driven event, there is no fee to attend the workshop. Make sure you'll attend the workshop if you've registered.

- [Suhan Acharya](https://github.com/suhanacharya), Core Team - DSC

## Post Event Report

We had a mixed audience of about 3:4 ratio of 1st years to 2nd years and most of the 1st years were new to programming therefore we had to slow down the workshop a bit but as the workshop slowly started to come to an end we had to take this speedrun seriously and kinda of blitzed through the last few topics. We then concluded the workshop with a group photo.

## Attendance

We welcomed about 25 interested students to the workshop. Which was composed of mostly 1st and 2nd year students.

## Positives

The students have been very active since they were beginners and interested in the event.
We got good feedback from the students, they wanted more workshops to be conducted for them in the future.

## Negatives

We were expecting more students to attend.

## Summary

We were able to cover most of the data structure topics in this speedrun and deliver it to the attendees. Finally conducted an offline workshop after a long time due to the pandemic. Got many attendees interested in the workshop.
