# Coursera for Campus

With the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, most of our daily activities have been drastically affected. In this trying time, as students, we find that our education has gone for a bit of a spin.

To combat this, Coursera has come up with a Campus Program that will give students free access to online courses and build the skills we lack right now. SOSC applied on behalf of Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, and we are excited to announce that our application has been accepted! We have **Mr. Prakhyath Rai** as the faculty coordinator for this program. To enroll, follow the instructions below:

3. Log in to Coursera.
4. Click on the drop-down button on the top left corner of the page and switch to Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management Sponsored Courses.
