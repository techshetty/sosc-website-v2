## About the Event

Hello Everyone 👋 . Hope you guys are having a cozy and safe quarantined vacation!

We at SOSC will be having a Virtual Hackathon 👨‍💻👩‍💻 for the probies, so you folks can learn something new these holidays and learn how to collaborate with each other. **The theme is Open, so anything goes** i.e. you can build anything.

### Agenda

1. Each team should register, consisting of 3️⃣ members.

2. Each team will be assigned a mentor 👨‍🏫 .

3. After you have been assigned with a mentor, you have to ideate your project. 💡

4. You will then be given **36 hours** to build your solution. (Try to build a team with diverse talents- I mean do you really need two designers 👩‍🎨 ⚔️👨‍🎨).

5. The projects will be evaluated and the best 3 among them will be featured in SOSC Instagram page.
