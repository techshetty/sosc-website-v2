## Manual Creation

### Creating a new Blog Post :memo:

To manually submit a new Blog post, create a new folder in the `src/content/blogs` directory. Name the folder with date of posting and slug eg: `first-blog-post`. Add the images you want to include in your blog inside the `/public/content/blogs/<folder-name>/` directory and create a markdown file with the name `index.md`. Add the following frontmatter details into the markdown file followed by your blog post in markdown format. And finally submit a Pull Request.

PS:

- Slug is where your blog post will be available on the website and the prefix `/blog/` is required to identify it as a blog.
- Description should be written in a single line, with considerably almost 2-3 lines as viewable. Make it short and descriptive.
- Date should be in the format YYYY-mm-dd
- Your author name should be your github profile url.
- Images should be referenced as `/content/blogs/<folder-name>/image.jpg`
